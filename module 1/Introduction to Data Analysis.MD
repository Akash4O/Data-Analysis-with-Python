**Data :**

    -> Data is collected everywhere around us,whether it's collected manually by scientists or collected digitally

    -> Data Analysis / Data science helps us to extract information and insights from raw data

**The Importance Of Data Analysis:**
    
    -> It helps us to discover useful information
    
    -> With data we can answer questions and even predict the future or the unknown

**Problem Scenario for better understanding:**

    -> Let's say there is a person Tom and he wants to sell his car

    -> But the problem is he doesn't know how much he should sell his car for.

    -> he also wants to set the price reasonably so someone would want to purchase it, so the price he sets should present the value of the car.

**Solution according to the thinking of Data Scientist/Analyst :**

    -> The analyst or Scientist will look for is there data on the price of other cars and their characteristics?

    -> What features can effect their prices?

    -> the features like color , Brand , Horsepower etc. affects the selling price.
