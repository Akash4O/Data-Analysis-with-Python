## Basic Insights from the data :

  * Understand your data before begin any analysis

  * Should check :

      * Data Types

      * Data Distribution

  * Local Potential issues with the data such as the wrong datatype of features, which may need t be resolved later on.
  
 **Dtype function :**

  // in pandas we use "dataframe.dtypes" to check data types

  df.dtypes  // it returns the data type of each column

 **Describe function :**

  df.describe()

  // Return the statistical summary of dataframe which can be used to find out the extreme outliers and large deviations.

  // the ouputs :
        // count : the number of terms
        // mean : average column values
        // std : column standard daviation
        // the maximum and minimum values
        // as well as the boundary of each quartiles
        //it ignores the rows and columns that do not contain numbers.

  df.describe(include="all") // it summarizes all the columns with or without numbers
  //additional outputs:
        // Unique : it is the number of ibjects in the column
        // top : it is the mot frequently occuring object
        // freq : it is the number of times the top object appears in the column

 **Info() function :**

  df.info() provides a concise summary of your DataFrame by showing top 30 and bottom 30 rows of the data frame
